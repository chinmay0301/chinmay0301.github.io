I am Chinmay Talegaonkar, a first year masters student in the department of ECE at UCLA. My Research interests broadly span the realm of unsupervised learning, Physics based learning with applications in Computer Vision, Re-inforcement learning and robotics. Currently I am working with [Prof. Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/) in the Visual Machines Group. In parallel (pun intended) CUDA Programming and optimization also interests me. I am interested in pursuing research that leads the foundation of deployable intelligent perception systems equipped with the knowledge (physics and semantics) of the environment. 

I recently completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2019. My Bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). We worked on Phase Retrieval methods for Poisson corrupted saturated fourier measurements. 
In the summer break of 2017, I worked with [Prof. Dirk Kroese](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DirkKroese/) on parallelizing Monte Carlo simulations using CUDA followed by an internship at NVidia, Bangalore in summer 2018, where I worked on optimizing [Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf) and DBscan (a clustering algorithm). My work at NVidia was used for their GPU based data science platform [rapids.ai](https://rapids.ai/). I will be interning at NVidia in Santa Clara this summer with the fast kernels team. 

I enjoy astrophysics and was involved extensively in the International Astronomy Olympiad Program as a participant while in high school and also as a academic committee member in 2016-17. I was a part of the Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay, and also a member of the editorial board [Insight](
https://www.insightiitb.org/). I enjoy writing poetry and a bit of stand-up comedy (cracking bad puns mostly), scenic photography, playing guitar and travelling in my leisure time.
