My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I am a first year PhD student at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/) in the College for Information and Computer Science. I am working with [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) on question generation. I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition and Computer Graphics.

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/).

In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). In Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution).

I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. In my free time I contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. I love cycling, and I have a cool little [collection]({{ site.url }}/assets/rubik.jpg) of Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I'm not so good at solving them!

Some people on the internet (especially on Mozilla's IRC) know me as *martianwars*.
