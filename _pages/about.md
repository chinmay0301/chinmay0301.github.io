I am Chinmay Talegaonkar, a final year undegraduate student of the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. My Research interests revolve around Image processing (in particular compressed sensing and related fields), Re-inforcement learning and optimization. Along with image processing, I am also interested in CUDA Programming and optimization. In a nutshell, anything that involves linear algebra, probabilistic modelling and has a practical application gets me going!

My Bachelor's thesis is supervised by [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). We are working on Phase Retrieval methods for Poisson corrupted saturated fourier measurements.
In the summer break of 2017, I worked with [Prof. Dirk Kroese](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DirkKroese/) on parallelizing Monte Carlo simulations using CUDA followed by an internship at NVidia this summer, where I worked on optimizing [Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf) and DBscan (a clustering algorithm).


I enjoy astrophysics and was involved extensively in the International Astronomy Olympiad Program as a participant while in high school and also as a academic committee member in 2016-17. I was a part of the Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay, and also a member of the editorial board [Insight](
https://www.insightiitb.org/). Currently I am one of the event managers of the [Inter IIT](http://inter-iit.tech/) being hosted at IIT Bombay this year in December. I enjoy writing poetry and a bit of stand-up comedy, scenic photography, playing guitar and travelling in my leisure time.
