I am a second year Ph.D. student at UCSD ECE. Currently I am a part of the [Computational Imaging and Systems Lab](https://computational-imaging.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. Prior to Joining UCSD, I was a Senior Deep Learning Engineer working on 6-DOF Pose Estimation at Akasha Imaging (now acquired by [Intrinsic.ai](https://intrinsic.ai/). I completed my M.S. in ECE from UCLA, where I worked with [Prof. Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/) at the [Visual Machines Group](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/), and undergrad from IIT Bombay, in Electrical Engineering. My current research interests include 3D scene representations, Computational Optics, and 3D Computer Vision. I have spent a couple of summers at NVIDIA and most recently at Qualcomm AI.
